# Debug Technique Detector

## Overview
The Debug Technique Detector is a tool designed to assist in malware analysis. It scans binary executables and detects common anti-debugging, timing attacks, and injection techniques that malware might use to evade detection or complicate the analysis process. By flagging these techniques, analysts can gain insights into the behavior of a given piece of malware and the challenges they may face when dissecting its code.

# HashHunt

## Overview
A tool designed to assist reverse engineers in unmasking encrypted API strings, commonly found in advanced malware techniques. By understanding and dynamically resolving these encryptions at runtime, this tool provides a robust solution to decrypt obscured API strings, making analysis much more feasible.
