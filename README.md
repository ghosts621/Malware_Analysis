# Debug Technique Detector

## Overview
The Debug Technique Detector is a tool designed to assist in malware analysis. It scans binary executables and detects common anti-debugging, timing attacks, and injection techniques that malware might use to evade detection or complicate the analysis process. By flagging these techniques, analysts can gain insights into the behavior of a given piece of malware and the challenges they may face when dissecting its code.
